# Analysis-on-the-incarceration-trends-dataset
This is a preliminary analysis on incarceration trends dataset. 
Here, I just show two simple plots. 

Plot #1:
I make this plot to find the change in percent of jail and prison population to total population across different race categories during the 1990-2015. Although the percent of black jail and prison population were well above that of other race categories, there are slight decrease in percent of black jail population and no obvious change in percent of black prison population. Percent of latino jail population decreased significantly. However, the percent of native American jail (prison) population and white jail (prison) population increased significantly during the 1990-2015. 
 
  
Plot #2: 





I think there are big exploration research space in this <incarceration dataset>. There are many implicit disciplines that could be found from this dataset. Besides, the reasons or potential explanations for the summaried phenomenon also deserve our further exploration. The possible answer for the incarceration trends could be the state or county-level GDP, the economic crisis, the status of president campaign, unemployement rate, level of education, even the climate change like the appearance of more frequent extreme climate event more or less. If I can be enrolled in this data science program, I want to delve further into this dataset and explore the correlated events.
